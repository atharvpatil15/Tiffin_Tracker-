    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to optimize for authorization independence, clarity, and scalability, aligning with the core principles outlined. We are using path-based ownership for user data and tiffin orders. The structure prioritizes ease of querying and secure rule creation.\n\n*   **Users Collection:**  The `users` collection stores user profiles. This ensures that all documents within the collection share the same security posture, simplifying rules.\n*   **Tiffin Orders Subcollection:**  Each user has a subcollection `tiffinOrders` to store their orders. This establishes clear ownership, eliminating the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules.\n\nThis design ensures authorization independence. Each `tiffinOrder` document is located within a user-specific subcollection. This structure inherently enforces that only the authenticated user (`request.auth.uid`) can access or modify their own tiffin order data, due to the path-based ownership. This means no `get()` calls are required to verify authorization, enabling atomic operations. QAPs are achieved by segregating data into user-owned subcollections, enabling secure list operations within each user's scope."
